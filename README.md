umnClassParser: exactly what it says on the tin
===============================================

This is a set of Python scripts I've been throwing together for the purpose of grabbing info from the University of Minnesota's class registration system, [OneStop](http://onestop.umn.edu/).

It's a serious work in progress. The closest I've come to a working parser is in old/queryOneStop.py. It sort of works, is terribly hacky, and is probably beyond hope. I think that redoing this code in BeautifulSoup should produce a more resilient result.
